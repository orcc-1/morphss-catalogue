Open Documentation of Methods refers to the practice of making research methodologies transparent and accessible to other researchers and the public. This includes detailed descriptions of research designs, data collection procedures, analytical approaches, and decision-making processes throughout the research lifecycle.

In the humanities and social sciences, open documentation of methods can take various forms, including pre-registration of studies, sharing of interview protocols and coding schemes, publication of analytical workflows, and provision of detailed methodological appendices.

The practice supports research transparency and enables other researchers to evaluate, replicate, or build upon existing work. It also facilitates methodological innovation by making diverse approaches visible and available for adaptation.

Open documentation of methods is particularly important in qualitative research, where the interpretive nature of analysis can make it challenging for readers to understand how conclusions were reached. Detailed documentation helps demonstrate the rigor and trustworthiness of qualitative findings.

Key considerations for open documentation include protecting participant confidentiality while providing sufficient detail for transparency, balancing comprehensive documentation with accessibility, and adapting documentation practices to disciplinary norms and expectations.
