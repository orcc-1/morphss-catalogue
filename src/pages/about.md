  <p>Open research is an umbrella term for a range of practices aimed at making the processes and outputs of research more widely available. Its aims and purposes include addressing knowledge inequities, democratising research processes and conversations, supporting collaborative efforts to address social and scientific problems, and enabling greater scrutiny of research findings.</p>

  <p>The MORPHSS Catalogue of Open Research Practices in the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences was created in 2025-6 as part of the <a href="#">MORPHSS project</a> (Materialising Open Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences). It includes details of open research practices in arts, humanities and social sciences (AHSS) disciplines, focusing in particular on the qualitative social sciences and areas of the arts and humanities outside the computational digital humanities - areas which have been under-addressed in existing accounts of open research.</p>
  <p>The catalogue is by no means exhaustive, but aims to collate a range of relevant open research practices across AHSS disciplines. These include a number of participatory approaches and forms of public scholarship, though we acknowledge that we have only been able to include a selection of representative practices from these broader categories. If you would like to suggest additional practices for inclusion, please see the 'Feedback' section on the right.</p>

  <h2>Information about open practices not included here</h2>
  <p>The catalogue does not include details of a number of open research practices, common to quantitative research in STEM subjects, that are already well-documented. Readers seeking information on these practices are directed to the sources listed below:</p>

  <h2>Feedback? Suggestions? Get in touch</h2>
  <p>We're keen to hear views from AHSS researchers and research-supporting organisations on how we can develop this resource. If you have feedback, or suggestions of practices you'd like to see included in the catalogue, please complete our <a href="#">feedback form</a> before 30th June 2026, after which work will begin on the next version of the catalogue, informed by community suggestions.</p>
