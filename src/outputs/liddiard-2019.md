comment: "Co-authored with the project's co-researchers, the article details Living Life to the Fullest, an arts-informed co-produced research project with young disabled people. It explores the ways in which the collaborative nature of the project led to the development of inclusive research practices that employed virtual research environments in innovative ways. The nature of co-researchers' involvement in shaping the project and co-authoring outputs is explicitly detailed, which is not always the case in the dissemination of co-produced research."
