comment: "Documents the process of member checking in a study on young women's confusing or non-consensual heterosexual experiences. The member checks here took the form of follow-up interviews with each participant to explore their perspective on the researcher's write-up of their original interview. The member check interview is theorised as giving participants space to reflect on their personal change through the process of participating in the study, a therapeutic process."
