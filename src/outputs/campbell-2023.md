comment: "In the context of a study of the experiences of survivors of sexual assault with the criminal legal system, the article offers an example of how even highly sensitive qualitative data can be de-identified in order to make it possible to share, while at the same time allowing participants' experiences to be articulated as far as possible in their own words. This was achieved through a structured protocol for identifying and remediating items in the data that pose potential reidentification risks."
