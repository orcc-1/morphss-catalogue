citation: "Emre, M. et al. (2020). <em>The Ferrante Letters: An Experiment in Collective Criticism</em>. Columbia University Press."
comment: "A hybrid critical project that grew out of an online, crowdsourced reading of Elena Ferrante's novels, first conducted through Public Books. The book curates letters, essays, and exchanges among scholars, critics, and readers to frame interpretation as collective, provisional, and dialogic, testing how authority, anonymity, and authorship function when criticism emerges from shared participation rather than a single critical voice."
