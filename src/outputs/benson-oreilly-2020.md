comment: "Detailed example of reflexive practice in a research project on the meaning of Brexit for expatriate Britons living in the EU, with a focus on three strategies: reflexive positioning (considering and taking into account positionality), reflexive navigating (actively learning from a reflexive approach to the unfolding research) and reflexive sense-making (recognising the (inter)personal situatedness, among researchers' and participants' contexts and perspectives, of broader interpretive processes)."
