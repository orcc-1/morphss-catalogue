comment: "Commenting on the lack of guidance or worked examples of how to conduct member checking, the authors offer a detailed account of a novel means of member checking. Adolescent participants in a study on gendered mathematics identity were asked to respond to 'I-poems' (poems created by isolating and combining I-statements) and word trees produced from their semi-structured interviews), highlighting disagreements, titling the poems, and discussing representational fit."
