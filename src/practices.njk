<section class="intro">
  <p>Open research is an umbrella term for a range of practices aimed at making the processes and outputs of research more widely available. Its aims and purposes include addressing knowledge inequities, democratising research processes and conversations, supporting collaborative efforts to address social and scientific problems, and enabling greater scrutiny of research findings. This catalogue was created in 2025-6 as part of the <a href="#">MORPHSS project</a> (Materialising Open Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences). It is a living showcase of exemplary open research practices within the humanities and social sciences disciplines that are not necessarily visible through the science-led open 'access' lens. <a href="#">Click to know more</a></p>
