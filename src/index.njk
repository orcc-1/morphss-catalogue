<section class="intro">
  <p>Practices are ways of doing, thinking, or making that shapes how knowledge is produced and shared. It emerges as much through habit, collaboration, and context as from rules, disciplines, and institutional expectations or conventions. This catalogue was created in 2025-6 as part of MORPHSS (Materialising Open Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences) research project. It is designed as a living, iterative, and collaborative showcase of exemplary open research practices within the humanities and social sciences disciplines. <a href="/about/">Learn more</a>.</p>
